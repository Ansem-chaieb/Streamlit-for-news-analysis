""Just ridiculous!""', 'The cause of his distress is a giant construction site blocking our view across the bay - a 1.3-gigawatt coal-fired power station in the making.', '""I don\'t understand why we still have to burn coal to generate electricity,"" says Saiki-San\'s friend, Rikuro Suzuki. ""This plant alone will emit more than seven million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year!""', ""Suzuki-San's point is a good one. Shouldn't Japan be cutting its coal consumption, not increasing it, at a time of great concern about coal's impact on the climate? "", 'So why the coal? The answer is the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.', ""In 2010 about one third of Japan's electricity came from nuclear power, and there were plans to build a lot more. But then the 2011 disaster hit, and all Japan's nuclear power plants were shut down. Ten years later most remain closed - and there is a lot of resistance to restarting them."", ""In their place Japan's gas-fired power stations have been doing a lot of overtime. But, as Britain has found out recently, natural gas is expensive."", 'So, the Japanese government decided to build 22 new coal-fired power stations, to run on cheap coal imported from Australia. Economically it made sense. Environmentally, not so much. Japan is now under intense pressure to stop using coal.', ""Instead of closing the old coal plants and switching to renewables, Japan's answer is to switch to burning hydrogen or ammonia. "", '""The investment made by electric power companies in coal-fired power plants would suddenly be useless without value in their balance sheet,"" says Prof Tomas Kaberger, an expert on energy policy at Chalmers University in Sweden.', '""And it would create financial difficulties for electric power companies and then for banks and pension funds. And that is the challenge for Japan.""', 'The plants can be quite easily converted to burning hydrogen or ammonia, neither of which produce any carbon dioxide. So this seems like a good solution.

Instead, it has a fuel cell under the bonnet, and hydrogen tanks under the back seat. Hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a fuel cell to form water, with the reaction releasing energy as electricity, which runs the electric motors. It's the same technology that was used to power the Apollo spacecraft on the Moon missions."", 'To many people this technology is an odd choice. It\'s more expensive and complicated than batteries. Elon Musk has called hydrogen cars ""stupid"".', ""Not true, says Hisashi Nakai, the head of Toyota's public affairs division.

Where is the hydrogen to power Japan zero carbon society going to come from?', 'The answer is ""blue hydrogen"".', 'Make hydrogen from water using renewable energy and you get ""green hydrogen"". The problem is green hydrogen is really expensive.', 'Instead, today most hydrogen is made from natural gas, or even coal. That is cheap but it produces lots of greenhouse gases. However, if you capture those greenhouse gases and bury them in the ground, you are allowed to call it ""blue hydrogen"".', 'This is exactly what Japan says it is going to do.', 'Earlier this year, Japan and Australia opened a joint project in the state of Victoria to turn a type of coal called lignite, or brown coal, into hydrogen. The hydrogen is then liquified to minus 253C, then piped into a specially built ship which carries it to Japan. ', 'What happens to the greenhouse gases produced at the site? Right now, they go straight up into the atmosphere.  But Japan and Australia are promising that, at some point in the future, they will begin capturing the greenhouse gas produced at the Latrobe Valley site and inject it into the sea floor off the coast.', 'Climate change campaigners are horrified by this plan. They say the technology to capture and store greenhouse gases is unproven and it will lock Japan into digging up vast quantities of brown coal for decades to come.', 'According to Prof Kaberger, the biggest hole in the plan is economic.', '""Technically it\'s possible, but it will always be expensive,"" he says. ""Using fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage will always be more expensive than using fossil fuels alone, and now in many parts of the world renewable electricity is already cheaper than fossil fuels without carbon capture.""', 'Prof Kaberger thinks the Japanese government chose blue hydrogen a decade ago when renewables were expensive, and they are now locked into a plan that no longer makes sense.', '""Japanese companies need cheap electricity to be competitive and they need clean electricity to be internationally acceptable,"" he says.

Winter storms that dumped heavy snow and rain across the state are not expected to be substantial enough to counterbalance drought conditions.', ""Lake Oroville plays a key role in California's complex water delivery system. "", 'This 65km-square body of water north of Sacramento is the second-largest reservoir in California.', 'Not only does Lake Oroville store water, it helps control flooding elsewhere in the region, assists with the maintenance of water quality and boosts the health of fisheries downstream.', 'In 2014, more than 80% of California was in the grip of an ""extreme drought"". Against this backdrop, Oroville\'s capacity fell to 30% - a historic low level.', ""As the water level receded to hundreds of feet below normal levels, ramps and roads no longer reached the water's edge."", 'More worryingly, the reservoir - when full - provided enough water for an estimated seven million households, as well as providing power for hydroelectricity facilities and irrigation for agricultural land.', ""The dry conditions didn't start in 2014, however, there had been a drought for years prior to Oroville recording its historic low level."", 'Indeed, the US space agency\'s Earth Observatory had warned that the multi-year drought was having a wider impact on the region. Among its effects was a contribution to ""unusually active and destructive"" fire seasons and poor yields from agricultural land.', '""There is strong evidence from climate models and centuries of tree ring data that suggest about one-third to one-half of the severity of the current drought can be attributed to climate change,"" observed Benjamin Cook, a climate scientist from Nasa\'s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.', 'Agency scientists added that the data suggested a ""megadrought"" might already be underway in this region - and that it could last for decades.

So, for example, episodes of flooding will increase, as well as episodes of droughts.', 'Lake Oroville was a perfect illustration of how these extremes can threaten our existing infrastructure.', ""While the lake's levels reached a historic low in 2014, the reservoir's vast embankment dam - the tallest in the US - was pushed to breaking point in February 2017."", 'Following fierce storms in the surrounding mountains, water was flowing into the lake at a rate of roughly one-and-a-half Olympic-size swimming pools each second.', 'Communities downstream had been evacuated, with more than 100,000 people being ordered to leave their homes.', 'Officials were struggling to allow water to flow out of the lake because the main spillway - a structure that provides controlled releases of water - and the emergency spillway had been eroded and damaged. ', 'Yet they had to continue sending water down the valley because the reservoir was reaching capacity and there was a sense that there could be a ""catastrophic failure"" in the structure.', 'In the space of two years, the lake went from an unprecedented low to a capacity that had not been experienced before. Water cascaded over the emergency spillways, which had not previously been required.', 'Traditionally, the lake was replenished by meltwater from a thawing snowpack in surrounding mountains, whose river systems fed the reservoir. June was the month when the reservoir was expected to reach its yearly maximum level.', 'However, in 2017, it was rain that caused the intense water flow. The reservoir had reached capacity in February, rather than the middle of the year, as usually happened.', 'Scientists again suggested that the event fitted into the paradigm of a warming world.', 'Speaking at the time to the Guardian newspaper, Prof Roger Bale, from the University of California Merced, explained: ""With a warmer climate, we get these winter storms, which dump rain rather than snow.""', 'The United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) said that the ""frequency and intensity of droughts, storms and extreme weather events are increasingly likely above 1.5C (above pre-industrial levels)"".', ""Failure to keep the global average temperature rise to below 1.5C, as outlined in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, is likely to result in more of the world's reservoirs or flood defences being tested to breaking point."", ""This is a stark warning for world leaders, who will be gathering once again this year at the UN's annual climate summit (COP26) - to be held in Glasgow.

"", 'As a converted outhouse, the building was badly insulated, especially the floors and walls. ', ""Poor insulation doesn't just mean higher bills for renters - it also has an impact on the environment. Heating buildings contributes to almost a quarter of all UK emissions and the more heat that escapes through walls and roofs, the more energy is wasted.

""I couldn\'t have done another winter in a freezing cold house.""', ""If you think your energy bills are too high or your home isn't staying warm, the first thing to do is check its energy performance certificate (EPC) online, says Dan Wilson Craw, from campaign group Generation Rent. "", 'Buildings are graded between A - the most energy efficient - and G. In England and Wales, homes must have a rating of at least E to be rented out, with only limited exemptions. The government has also consulted on raising the minimum standard to band C. ', 'In Scotland, the government plans to require privately rented properties to have a rating of at least C from 2025. ', 'Damp or mould is another sign that your home may be poorly insulated. ', 'There is government advice available online on how to make your home more energy efficient, which Mr Craw advises renters look at before approaching their landlord. ', 'But if landlords refuse to take action you can ask the local council to carry out an inspection. Councils are responsible for enforcing health and safety standards of homes and if they find serious issues with damp or heating, they can force the landlord to make improvements. ', ""Mr Craw says there are also grants and funding available through some councils and energy companies to help make your home more energy efficient if you're on a low income. "", 'However, research by Generation Rent suggests many renters are reluctant to demand or invest in improvements because they are unsure whether they will live in a home long enough to benefit from the cheaper bills. ', 'Others may be worried that if their landlord does pay for improvements, they may increase the rent to recoup costs or even evict them. ', 'Mr Craw says government plans to abolish section 21 ""no fault"" evictions, which would prevent landlords evicting tenants without good reason, will help give renters more certainty about how long they will be living somewhere. ', 'Generation Rent also supports raising minimum energy efficiency standards for rented homes - and wants tenants to be able to claim back rent if landlords break the rules. ', 'And the group wants to limit the amount landlords can increase rent for existing tenants to wage inflation, to avoid them upping the rent if they are forced to pay for improvements. ', 'For landlords, the main barrier to making improvements is cost, according to Chris Norris, from the National Residential Landlords Association. ', 'Nearly one in five households in England live in the private rented sector, but this type of housing tends to be older and more difficult to insulate.

', 'But heat pumps can cost between £6,000 and £18,000 - not including any expensive new insulation that may also be needed - so the subsidy would not cover the total cost. ', 'As well as more generous grants, the association also wants to see tax deducted from spending on energy efficiency to give landlords an extra financial incentive. ', 'With gas prices surging, Mr Craw says making homes more energy efficient is even more urgent.

The government has also consulted on raising the minimum standard to band C. ', 'In Scotland, the government plans to require privately rented properties to have a rating of at least C from 2025. ', 'Damp or mould is another sign that your home may be poorly insulated. ', 'There is government advice available online on how to make your home more energy efficient, which Mr Craw advises renters look at before approaching their landlord. ', 'But if landlords refuse to take action you can ask the local council to carry out an inspection. Councils are responsible for enforcing health and safety standards of homes and if they find serious issues with damp or heating, they can force the landlord to make improvements. ', ""Mr Craw says there are also grants and funding available through some councils and energy companies to help make your home more energy efficient if you're on a low income. "", 'However, research by Generation Rent suggests many renters are reluctant to demand or invest in improvements because they are unsure whether they will live in a home long enough to benefit from the cheaper bills. ', 'Others may be worried that if their landlord does pay for improvements, they may increase the rent to recoup costs or even evict them. ', 'Mr Craw says government plans to abolish section 21 ""no fault"" evictions, which would prevent landlords evicting tenants without good reason, will help give renters more certainty about how long they will be living somewhere. ', 'Generation Rent also supports raising minimum energy efficiency standards for rented homes - and wants tenants to be able to claim back rent if landlords break the rules. ', 'And the group wants to limit the amount landlords can increase rent for existing tenants to wage inflation, to avoid them upping the rent if they are forced to pay for improvements.

', 'As well as more generous grants, the association also wants to see tax deducted from spending on energy efficiency to give landlords an extra financial incentive.

""This plant alone will emit more than seven million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year!""', ""Suzuki-San's point is a good one. Shouldn't Japan be cutting its coal consumption, not increasing it, at a time of great concern about coal's impact on the climate? "", 'So why the coal? The answer is the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.', ""In 2010 about one third of Japan's electricity came from nuclear power, and there were plans to build a lot more. But then the 2011 disaster hit, and all Japan's nuclear power plants were shut down. Ten years later most remain closed - and there is a lot of resistance to restarting them."", ""In their place Japan's gas-fired power stations have been doing a lot of overtime. But, as Britain has found out recently, natural gas is expensive."", 'So, the Japanese government decided to build 22 new coal-fired power stations, to run on cheap coal imported from Australia. Economically it made sense. Environmentally, not so much. Japan is now under intense pressure to stop using coal.', ""Instead of closing the old coal plants and switching to renewables, Japan's answer is to switch to burning hydrogen or ammonia. "", '""The investment made by electric power companies in coal-fired power plants would suddenly be useless without value in their balance sheet,"" says Prof Tomas Kaberger, an expert on energy policy at Chalmers University in Sweden.', '""And it would create financial difficulties for electric power companies and then for banks and pension funds. And that is the challenge for Japan.""', 'The plants can be quite easily converted to burning hydrogen or ammonia, neither of which produce any carbon dioxide. So this seems like a good solution.

Where is the hydrogen to power Japan zero carbon society going to come from?', 'The answer is ""blue hydrogen"".', 'Make hydrogen from water using renewable energy and you get ""green hydrogen"". The problem is green hydrogen is really expensive.', 'Instead, today most hydrogen is made from natural gas, or even coal. That is cheap but it produces lots of greenhouse gases. However, if you capture those greenhouse gases and bury them in the ground, you are allowed to call it ""blue hydrogen"".', 'This is exactly what Japan says it is going to do.', 'Earlier this year, Japan and Australia opened a joint project in the state of Victoria to turn a type of coal called lignite, or brown coal, into hydrogen. The hydrogen is then liquified to minus 253C, then piped into a specially built ship which carries it to Japan. ', 'What happens to the greenhouse gases produced at the site? Right now, they go straight up into the atmosphere.  But Japan and Australia are promising that, at some point in the future, they will begin capturing the greenhouse gas produced at the Latrobe Valley site and inject it into the sea floor off the coast.', 'Climate change campaigners are horrified by this plan. They say the technology to capture and store greenhouse gases is unproven and it will lock Japan into digging up vast quantities of brown coal for decades to come.', 'According to Prof Kaberger, the biggest hole in the plan is economic.', '""Technically it\'s possible, but it will always be expensive,"" he says. ""Using fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage will always be more expensive than using fossil fuels alone, and now in many parts of the world renewable electricity is already cheaper than fossil fuels without carbon capture.""', 'Prof Kaberger thinks the Japanese government chose blue hydrogen a decade ago when renewables were expensive, and they are now locked into a plan that no longer makes sense.', '""Japanese companies need cheap electricity to be competitive and they need clean electricity to be internationally acceptable,"" he says.

', ""Scientists hope this ice can help them explain why Earth's ice ages flipped in frequency in the deep past."", '""Beyond EPICA"", as the project is known, is a follow-up to a similar venture at the turn of the millennium called simply EPICA (European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica). ', 'The new endeavour will base itself a short distance away from the original at Little Dome C, an area located roughly 40km from the Italian-French Concordia Station, on the east Antarctic plateau.', ""At an altitude of 3,233m above sea level and over 1,000km from the coast, Little Dome C will be an inhospitable place to work. Even in summer, temperatures won't get much above -35C. "", 'The camp where the drill team will base itself was set up in the 2019/20. This coming season will largely be about putting in the necessary drilling infrastructure. But the technicians do aim to at least start on their core quest by getting down beyond the first 100m.', 'This should take the borehole past the lightly compacted snow layers, or firn, into the impervious ice layers that are the real interest for scientists.', 'The deep ice in Antarctica contains tiny bubbles of air. These little gas pockets are a direct snapshot of the historic atmosphere.', 'Scientists can read off the levels of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping components, such as methane.', 'Analysing the atoms in the water-ice molecules encasing the gases also gives an indication of the temperature that persisted at the time of the snowfall that gave rise to the ice. ', 'When researchers drilled the original EPICA core, they uncovered a narrative of past climate temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide stretching back 800,000 years.', ""It's become one of the key climate data-sets of recent decades."", 'It showed that CO2 and temperature moved in lock-step. Whenever the Earth went into an ice age and temperature fell, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would also decline. And when the climate warmed back up again, the CO2 rose in parallel.', ""These cycles occurred roughly every 100,000 years - a phasing that is most likely linked to slight shifts in the eccentricity of Earth's orbit (a larger or smaller ellipse) around the Sun."", 'But it is recognised from an alternative record of past climate, which has been deciphered from ocean sediments, that deeper back in time the ice age cycle was much shorter - at about every 41,000 years.', 'That is a period probably dominated by the way the Earth tilts back and forth on its axis. But why the switch occurred, no-one is really sure. The new Beyond Epica core may contain some clues if its ices can extend the climate narrative back to 1.5 million years ago.', '""We believe this ice core will give us information on the climate of the past and on the greenhouse gases that were in the atmosphere during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), which happened between 900,000 and 1.2 million years ago,"" said team-leader Carlo Barbante, the director of the Institute of Polar Sciences of the National Research Council of Italy.', '""During this transition, climate periodicity between ice ages changed from 41,000 to 100,000 years: the reason why this happened is the mystery we hope to solve.""', 'To achieve an 800,000-year record, the original EPICA project drilled to a depth of 2,774m. The bedrock at Little Dome C is just over 2,800m down. The extra 700,000 years being sought by the new project should be in the additional metres of layered ice. ', '""We already have the 800,000 years of ice, so much of the first few years of drilling will simply be a repeat of ice we already have,"" explained Robert Mulvaney from the British Antarctic Survey.', '""In practice, with many new PhD students coming online, and new groups getting involved, and new analytical techniques always being developed, we will make good use of the ice younger than 800,000 years.

You're making it all up about global warming, a man shouted as he approached me. We were in the Royal Society, the UK's leading scientific academy, and a panel discussion about climate change had just finished. It's nothing to do with carbon dioxide, he bellowed, before security guards led him away."", 'Climate change has aroused passionate debate because it raises questions about our lifestyles and modern economies. And in the early days of my reporting, the picture was not as clear as now. The basic physics had long been understood: that adding certain types of gases to the air will trap more heat.', 'But nearly 20 years ago, the United Nations climate science panel was still cautious, saying it was ""likely"" not ""certain"" that human activity was driving up temperatures.', 'Researchers were gathering more evidence all the time and I witnessed much of their work: in a crevasse in Antarctica where bubbles of air, trapped in the luminous blue ice, held clues about the ancient atmosphere; watching an Oxford professor kneeling in the Kalahari desert to count grains of sand to calculate how far the dunes might spread with global warming; and riding an armoured vehicle through Siberia to research how the permafrost is melting.', ""And this fieldwork, combined with data from satellites and results from models run on supercomputers, led to a landmark conclusion recently: that it's now 'unequivocal' that it's us heating up the planet."", 'At the same time, the implications of a more hostile climate were becoming clearer. A rise in the global temperature of up to 2C used to be thought of as ""safe"". And on my first trip to the Greenland ice sheet, in 2004, researchers were talking of the melting ice as more of a problem for the future. That was soon to change.', 'We now know that a rise of just over one degree is proving dangerous. And returning to the same spot in Greenland 15 years later was a shock. Where towering cliffs of ice once stood there was now bare rock. The remaining ice seemed diminished. In the mild temperatures I felt uncomfortably hot while meltwater was pouring into the ocean, raising its level.', 'And this creates a profound unfairness about climate change. While a city like London can defend itself with the gleaming steel of the Thames Barrier, many communities around the world are unprotected.', 'In Gabura, on the coast of Bangladesh, a feeble embankment was breached by a storm and, when we visited back in 2009, the village was being flooded every high tide. We waded into the water to film a large and desperate crowd using mud to try to hold back the sea. ', ""There was no other option. You might think international aid would have made a difference over the past decade or so. It hasn't. Seawater is still poisoning the wells and the fields. There are sandbags on the embankments now but they're no guarantee as the level of the sea keeps climbing, as distant Greenland loses its ice."", ""Like all developing countries, Bangladesh was told 12 years ago that by now there'd be a steady flow of a guaranteed amount of finance from the richest nations. It's a promise that's remained unfulfilled. And this was a major source of contention at the COP26 climate conference."", ""There is a pattern at many of these annual events - and I've now been to 10 of them."", 'Global leaders make emotional speeches about saving the planet but then leave their negotiators to protect national interests by haggling aggressively over each line. In Glasgow, the trickiest tussle was over coal, with India and China demanding that the words ""phasing out"" were altered to ""phasing down"".', 'The COP26 president Alok Sharma had to hold back tears. The pressures of corralling nearly 200 countries are intense. At a conference in Bali, the chair actually broke down. And at another gathering, in Copenhagen, many African delegates walked out in protest. Meanwhile the gases raising temperatures have been steadily increasing.', 'Yet there are some positive signs. When I first watched a windfarm being built, it was a slow process and very expensive, and the idea of planting turbines out at sea seemed outlandish. Now both wind and solar power are far cheaper and are therefore more plausible and attractive to investors. So are batteries. The giant car makers are having to go electric.', ""Most countries - and many companies - have committed to being carbon neutral by the middle of the century. Some are more sincere about this than others. But greater scrutiny and more public awareness mean there's less room to dodge and hide. It's becoming harder to greenwash. And the annual conferences, for all their watering-down of final conclusions, do provide momentum and a sense of direction."", ""So along with feeling despair at the damage that extreme weather is causing to the most vulnerable people, I'm also inspired by a new level of engagement, a surge of clever innovations and a younger generation mobilised and determined to find a way through."", ""Humans can be staggeringly short sighted but also ingenious when faced with real trouble.

Greenland is sitting in blue sea for three months losing ice. Temperatures in the polar summer were 32C … the forests were on fire.', '“Even if we cut emissions completely we’d still be in a difficult place because of the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere already.”', 'There\'s a similar message from Prof Piers Forster, coordinating lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “People are already dying and species are becoming extinct with current temperatures,"" he said.

One of several global cities deemed at severe risk from flooding, it was there to share the innovative measures it is using in the hope of keeping its head above water. ', 'Paul Tempest was among thousands of people who had to flee their homes when Hull was hit by almost biblical floods in 2007.', '""We saw the water rising in the garden, then while trying to barricade the doors with sandbags the carpet in the hallway started to rise beneath your feet,"" he says.', '""Water was coming through the air bricks, filling the void and the floorboards. Then everything started to rise.""', 'He was unable to return to his house in the Cottingham area for a year. Thankfully, his home has not been flooded since. But after a storm surge battered the city in 2013, the threat of further misery from rising water levels is an ever-present worry for many in Hull.', ""With its rich maritime history, water has been at the centre of Hull's lives and livelihoods for centuries. But it could equally pose the biggest threat to its existence - a fact the devastating flooding events in recent years has brought into sharp focus."", 'Home to about 260,000 people, Hull is second only to London in the rankings of UK cities deemed most vulnerable to flooding. Occupying the flat bottom of a low-lying land basin, about 90% of it sits below sea level at high tide, and just 2% is considered not to be at risk from flooding.', 'It is also surrounded by water. The River Hull snakes through its centre and out into the Humber Estuary - a shipping port and gateway to the nearby North Sea. On the government\'s National Risk Register, coastal flooding is second only to pandemics in terms of the ""high-consequence"" threats facing the country. ', '""Hull floods in every way it is possible to flood, it\'s experienced all the different types,"" says Prof Dan Parsons, director of the Energy and Environment Institute at the University of Hull.', '""The city sits below the high tide mark, so the city defences keep the tidal water away but it means any water that comes into the city has to be pumped out, including the rainfall and some of the river flows.""', ""Prof Parsons' assessment is not theoretical. Within the last 15 years the city has experienced two major floods that affected thousands of people and caused millions in damage."", ""The first came in 2007 during the UK's wettest summer on record. Surface water and river flooding affected more than 55,000 homes and businesses across the country. "", 'About one-fifth of those were in Hull.', ""Thousands were evacuated from their homes on 25 June when the city's drainage systems were overwhelmed by the deluge. Michael Barnett, 28, died from hypothermia after he became trapped in a storm drain. Nearly all of the city's 98 schools were damaged, with total flood repair costs across Hull put at more than £40m."", 'Six years later, in 2013, Hull was hit by a different type of flood, when a storm surge combined with high spring tides to create record water levels along coastlines and in tidal rivers. ', ""The 5 December surge caused 400 properties to flood, with the River Hull's tidal surge barrier - which prevents water moving upstream from the Humber Estuary - coming within 0.40m (1ft 4ins) of being overwhelmed. "", 'Something more needed to be done. Over the course of 10 years after the 2007 flood, ""different agencies spent hundreds of millions of pounds on pumping, drainage, flood defence,"" says Lee Pitcher, from the Living With Water partnership. But Hull remained the second most at-risk place in the country.', ""It became clear a significant change in the city's flood prevention priorities was needed. At a 2017 meeting inside Hull's aquarium, The Deep, which sits a stone's throw away from the tidal barrier, a new approach was agreed."", '""It felt like this was the time to do something really different and radical,"" says Mr Pitcher, whose group was formed after the meeting by bringing together separate agencies responsible for water management in the city.', 'Hull joined a support network of five global cities directly affected by water, with the group helping to form a ""global standard"" for water resilience. Four years on, Mr Pitcher was on-stage at COP26 sharing the city\'s new approach with the world. ', 'It works in part by moving away from the grey infrastructure of human-engineered barriers to ""blue-green"" sustainable systems which often use natural drainage provided by green spaces. ""Aqua greens"" - natural water traps - have been created across the city, slowing the flow of surface water during downpours and relieving pressure on drainage systems. ', '""It\'s OK that the park is flooded, because it\'s supposed to flood when it rains heavily and that\'s a good thing as it\'s no longer in your home,"" Prof Parsons says. According to Living With Water, Hull had the same amount of rainfall in October 2019 as it saw in 2007, but didn\'t suffer any flooding. ', 'New housing developments will be told to follow a design guide including water butts to catch water from drainpipes, permeable paving for rainwater and gardens filled with vegetation to soak up rain. ', 'Mr Tempest, who now has multiple lagoon areas designed to catch run-off water near his house in Cottingham, says: ""It has taken a long time, but they\'re not just blots on the landscape any more.', '""They\'re green lagoons which look good and do feel very safe.""', 'Mr Pitcher says the unified approach agreed four years ago - which brought in authorities from around East Yorkshire - has helped to drive the changes.', '""We\'re managing water throughout the system collectively - it doesn\'t matter where it came from originally, the fact is it\'s water in someone\'s garden, potentially in someone\'s house, or it\'s on the road and it\'s holding up traffic,"" he says.', '""We collectively need to stop that from happening, and that mindset change might sound obvious, but it\'s making a huge difference.""', 'The approach is similar to the ""sponge city"" concept that is being rolled out in several Chinese cities, where floods could become something residents embrace rather than fear. Education is another key plank of Hull\'s strategy, and a ""flood curriculum"" is being taught in the city\'s schools. ', 'Pupils at Withernsea High School, 15 miles (24km) east of Hull, have created a film highlighting the impact of coastal erosion - another climate change-linked threat facing the area. ', 'Pupil Ellis Thomson, 13, says: ""Climate change is important to me as it is happening around me locally and I see it every day. ', '""It makes me feel quite worried and sad because in a few years, some of the places that I have grown up knowing might be in the sea.""', 'Chloe Armitage, also 13, adds: ""If we don\'t get things right now, then what future will there be?""', ""Despite all its changes, Hull's unenviable position near the top of the at-risk list stubbornly remains. Thoughts have turned to whether even more radical solutions may be needed. The Environment Agency has warned water levels on the Humber could rise by over 3ft (1m) in the next 100 years, and ideas are being discussed on how best to protect and adapt for the long term.  "", ""The Humber 2100+ project is considering not only conventional defences, but more ambitious solutions such as a multi-billion pound Humber tidal barrier four times the size of London's Thames Barrier."", 'Other ideas put forward include a lagoon on the estuary to create a giant shield against tidal flooding.', 'The Shorelines Project, a group which commissions climate change-related murals across the city, says their often provocative pieces may help people consider not only their own lives but those of generations to come. ', '""It\'s about sparking a discussion but it\'s also about being hopeful, it\'s about making decisions that believe in future generations having a future,"" says project director Naomi Luhde-Thompson.  ', 'Prof Parsons says: ""It\'s not about a \'Venice of the north\' type narrative, there are ways we can manage the risk that are sustainable and lead to a long, prosperous future for Hull but we need to embrace the solutions and bring the communities with us.""', 'Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

', ""It's an issue which has to be tackled at government level if temperature rises are to be limited to 1.5C - the level considered the gateway to dangerous climate change. "", 'However, many major coal-dependent countries - such as Australia, the US, China and India - have declined to sign a deal at the summit aimed at phasing out the energy source in the coming decades. ', 'A recent UN report has suggested that reducing emissions of methane could make an important contribution to tackling the planetary emergency. ', 'A substantial amount of methane is released from ""flaring"" - the burning of natural gas during oil extraction - and could be stopped with technical fixes. Finding better ways of disposing of rubbish is also important, because landfill sites are another big methane source.', 'At COP26, nearly 100 countries agreed to cut methane emissions, in a deal spearheaded by the US and the EU. The Global Methane Pledge aims to limit methane emissions by 30% compared with 2020 levels.', 'Electricity and heat generation make a greater contribution to global emissions than any economic sector. ', 'Transforming the global energy system from one reliant on fossil fuels to one dominated by clean technology - known as decarbonisation - is critical for meeting current climate goals. ', 'Wind and solar power will need to dominate the energy mix by 2050 if countries are to deliver on their net zero targets.', 'There are challenges, however.', 'Less wind means less electricity generated, but better battery technology could help us store surplus energy from renewables, ready to be released when needed.', ""We'll also need to change the way we power the vehicles we use to get around on land, sea and in the air. "", 'Ditching petrol and diesel cars and switching to electric vehicles will be critical. ', 'Lorries and buses could be powered by hydrogen fuel, ideally produced using renewable energy. ', 'And scientists are working on new, cleaner fuels for aircraft, although campaigners are also urging people to reduce the number of flights they take. ', ""A UN report in 2018 said that, to have a realistic chance of keeping the global temperature rise under 1.5C, we'll have to remove CO2 from the air. "", 'Forests are excellent at soaking it up from the atmosphere - one reason why campaigners and scientists emphasise the need to protect the natural world by reducing deforestation. ', 'Programmes of mass tree-planting are seen as a way of offsetting CO2 emissions. ', 'Trees are likely to be important as countries wrestle with their net zero targets, because once emissions have been reduced as much as possible, remaining emissions could be ""cancelled out"" by carbon sinks such as forests. ', 'Emerging technologies that artificially remove CO2 from the atmosphere, or stop it being released in the first place, could play a role. ', 'A number of direct-air capture facilities are being developed, including plants built by Carbon Engineering in Texas and Climeworks in Switzerland. They work by using huge fans to push air through a chemical filter that absorbs CO2. ', 'Another method is carbon capture and storage, which captures emissions at ""point sources"" where they are produced, such as at coal-fired power plants. The CO2 is then buried deep underground. ', 'However, the technology is expensive - and controversial, because it is seen by critics as helping perpetuate a reliance on fossil fuels. ', 'At the Copenhagen COP summit in 2009, rich countries pledged to provide $100bn (£74.6bn) in financing by 2020, designed to help developing countries fight and adapt to climate change. ', 'That target date has not been met, although the UK government, as holders of the COP presidency, recently outlined a plan for putting the funding in place by 2023.

A shift from gas to electricity has left many paying much higher bills. But the price signals may be switched, to discourage further gas and push people to electricity.

It's roughly half of all the spending by governments in Scotland in one year, including pensions, benefits and public services."", ""Unlike those, it's capital investment, so it gives lasting returns. However, it's six times the size of this year's Scottish government capital budget."", 'And it comes to around £6000 per head.', 'The better news is that it is spending that should generate jobs in manufacturing and installation.  The Scottish government estimates that could be 16,400 new roles.', 'Much of the bill will fall to private homeowners, who account for most homes in Scotland.

But for the social rented sector alone, which has relatively good quality stock after years of improvements, the bill looks like £6bn.', 'What concerns her most, she adds, is the problem of fuel poverty - those who have to pay more than 10% of disposable income to meet their energy bills. That accounts for quarter of households, or 1.2m people, she says, and a third of social renters.', 'They have to be taken on the ""net zero journey"", and can\'t be left with new heating technology that doesn\'t work for them, or that makes their homes more expensive to heat.', 'Nor can boilers be the only answer, if heat is then escaping from drafty building fabric, windows and roofs. Improved insulation is a much bigger technical and financial challenge in existing housing stock, and for windswept Scotland in particular.', ""The Scottish government knows it's not enough, adds Sally Thomas.  Among the options are private investment and debt funding. There's a lot of investment money looking for a green home, even if financial returns are unexciting."", ""The Scottish government acknowledges its funding is only the start.

""It starts around £210m. But if we think about communities around the district, such as Gorbals, Calton, Drygate, Townhead and Ladywell, you start to get into larger numbers of up to half a billion pounds.  That includes heat, providing grid resilience, and also transport and active travel. The whole city has to change and innovate to meet the carbon agenda in front of us.""', 'The project is just one of those in need of a lot money. Glasgow City Council has identified £30bn of projects like this, aiming to make the city net zero by 2030. ', ""Clearly, that kind of moola is not going to come from council tax.

A longer, perhaps slower return, with strong covenants made by the city, will enable that long-term investment to be made. That provides an investment horizon that is attractive to some investment funds - for instance, pension funds.""', 'Such projects are being given a colossal boost by the shift of investment funds to making the great energy transition work. Mobilising the finance sector to tackle climate change is a key element of the COP26 gathering. And at a mind-bending scale. ', 'Going into COP26, the concern was that governments in more prosperous nations have failed to meet their pledge to shift $100bn to poorer ones, to help them mitigate the effects of climate change, and to adapt to it. Yet that huge sum is chickenfeed in comparison with something called GFANZ - the Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero.', ""If it turns out to be everything it claims, it could be worth 1300 times more than that target for transfers. At $130 trillion, or £95,000,000,000,000, it's an unimaginably large figure. If it helps, consider it nearly fifty times bigger than all the output in a year from the whole UK economy."", 'Some 450 financial institutions across 45 countries are signed up to making those funds available for the transition; asset managers, banks, pension funds are in there, including money they have already committed to backing companies with new products and technology, and building renewable power capacity, as well as much more investment required in the future.', 'Inside the United Nations blue zone of the COP26 summit, a lot of projects for cities, regions, and energy utilities are in search of funds, and a lot of funds are in search of quality investment opportunities.', '""A mile wide and an inch deep,"" says one pressure group activist. Maybe so. The proof will have to be seen within very few years. And if the initiative succeeds in developing reliable, worldwide accounting standards for carbon impact, the evidence should be clear.', '""It\'s hugely significant to have commitments at this scale from private sector banks and other financiers, because the scale of the need is in the multi-trillions of dollars,"" says Sir Danny Alexander - former Highland MP and senior figure in the UK government 10 years ago, who has spent the past five years as vice-president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). ', '""This can\'t be met from government budgets by themselves or from international financial institutions like the AIIB or World Bank,"" he says. ""It requires the crowding in of private capital at a very large scale.', '""The key next step is: how can we make sure that we\'re develop the quality of projects necessary to enable that to flow in practice? We have the commitments. We now have to make those into reality in climate investment, especially in the developing world, where many climate financiers see risks that need to be dealt with.""', 'The former Lib Dem minister says business minds have been shifting fast. Business can see from governments\' agenda at COP and beyond the scale of investment needed around the world, and so investors adapt to that. ""Plus institutions have seen their own investors putting pressure on them"".', 'He adds: ""Given the scale of need, there are huge opportunities for companies that get ahead of the game"". One message repeated often at COP is that climate change is not a cost and a burden that reduces living standards, but a source of future profit. ', 'By definition, no business leader wants to be left behind when opportunity knocks. They are also wise to avoid pressure to change from their consumers and activists, but some are slow to realise the implications for their own sectors.', 'Sian Sutherland is a London entrepreneur who set up A Plastic Planet, ""to ignite and inspire the world to turn off the plastic tap"". Leading one of the many pressure groups attending the COP, she told me of its campaign to highlight the 70% of fabrics in the world\'s clothing that are made from oil-based synthetic yarn. ', 'Going to fashion companies and retailers with the opportunity to get ahead of the campaign, with public commitments to shift to natural textiles and shape consumer trends, she was disappointed by the response. ', 'So she\'s going to banks and pension funds who sit behind the 20 or so plastics manufacturers who dominate the industry, and to textile companies: ""Finance is waking up to the power that it has"". And activists are getting smarter about using shareholdings to hit companies where they are required to respond.', '(Some, at least at the high end of fashion, have long been on board: designer Stella McCartney was at the Kelvingrove Museum this week, extolling the virtues of a leather substitute made from mushroom roots.)', ""So the finance sector is responding to pressure and to opportunities. One of those with a sponsorship role at the COP is NatWest, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland, which claims £100bn of lending is to back green investment. Critics point to more than twice as much that is not committed that way, and ask what it's being used for. "", 'But according to finance director, Katie Murray: ""It\'s impacting everything we do - in our own operations and in how we lend to our customers, their transition plans, how we record within our financial statements, how we help our customers measure. ', '""It\'s in my own executive remuneration, so it flows from the executive board all the way down through the organisation.""', 'The impact hits home: ""In terms of lending, we\'re looking to reduce the carbon impact of our balance sheet by 50% from 2030. We\'ve got small exposure of 0.7% to traditional oil, gas and coal, but we\'ve got a very big mortgage book, so one of the things we\'ve been talking about in COP is the impact of the older traditional housing we live in. ', '""We\'ve been looking to how we move that to Energy Performance Certificate C and above (the more efficient ratings). We have discounted mortgages for A and B. So it\'s a question of how we shift that forward.""', 'That sort of thinking - attaching conditions to mortgages, or pricing them according to energy efficiency - could have a profound effect on the housing market, and potentially deliver better insulation more effectively than government action could require or afford.', 'As Britain\'s biggest business lender, NatWest is taking the message to 2 million customers, with both sticks and carrots: ""We worked out our targets for the four main sectors: agricultural, automotive, oil and gas, and our mortgage book, and we\'re going through our book sector by sector, and saying: who has the right transition plans, who needs help, how can we measure it?""', ""If there's no plan, there could be uncomfortable discussions with the bank manager"", '""We set up a great partnership with Microsoft to help businesses measure. If you\'re a midsize or small business, the task of measuring your output in carbon is a daunting task. It\'s incredibly technical"".  The NatWest finance director adds: ""I don\'t believe there\'s any industry that\'s untouched by what\'s going on this week.""', ""Some of the more unlikely candidates for green credentials are in Glasgow to say they want to be part of the story. Holcim, for example, is a gigantic Swiss-based manufacturer of cement, with a vast carbon footprint for its manufacturing processes and transport, even before it's poured into buildings and roads."", 'Chief executive Jen Jenisch was seeking out media exposure, to brush aside the demonisation of the sector and the threat of having to shrink what his company does. ""We have a great roadmap to decarbonise,"" he said.', '""We have many steps to go there. We have relaunched new products with a reduced carbon footprint. We\'re very engaged in smarter designs for housing, with 3D printing where you use less material.""', ""Amid this giant green trade fair, Jenisch was in Glasgow to meet haulage firms, wanting to find out how they could cut his use of carbon in getting cement to where it's required. He says the future of a big manufacturing company could become more of a technology and recycling specialist - perhaps cutting tonnage but adding value: "", '""We want to reduce the amount of fresh cement produced. We want to use a lot of mineral by-products, like demolition waste, to make the product sustainable. Recycling will be a big part of our future, where we can make old buildings into new ones.""', 'Back in the finance sector, insurance is re-pricing the risk from climate change as one driver of consumer behaviour - to keep buildings off flood plains, for instance, but with a disproportionate hit to poorer countries which are more exposed. Munich Re is very large insurer and re-insurer for other insurance firms, wielding its own investment funds.', 'Chief executive Joachim Wenning has signed up to be part of GFANZ, saying it is a ""very clear sign that the private sector is engaging and has to engage to help and enable the energy transition to combat climate change. It is important that it is visible the private sector is at the forefront of this development. ', '""What we need to have is also government engagement. Private sector engagement alone will not bring the necessary transition. We need road maps from countries that clearly define what sort of renewables [they will have] and how fast they will build up, so that the private sector can invest into this road map.""', 'The insurer says that activists - making their noisy presence felt outside the blue zone as well as part of the conversation inside it - are necessary because of the failure of governments to lead. Beyond that, international links across campaign groups help to put pressure on governments that are slower to cut carbon emissions, such as China or India.', ""He reinforces a point I've been hearing from others about the pressure exerted on senior executives inside their organisations. At Holcim cement, Jen Jenisch said that his Zoom calls with staff across the 72,000-employee empire have recently been around 80% about climate change."", 'Dr Wenning at Munich Re says the younger generation in his company, and in others, ""is fiercely advocating combatting climate change. Fiercely. And they demand everything be done from the symbolic to fundamental, in personal behaviour and in how we invest.""', 'He broadens the point, with a plea: ""This generation tends to believe industry is the problem, because they are emitting. But they emit to make products we consume. We have to make the private sector part of the solution, and for this we need an economy-friendly environment, and not one where people put limits, limits, limits, prohibiting this and that.

We've followed five items that cause recycling confusion on their journey through a recycling plant to help you think before you throw."", ""From a metal gantry high above the factory floor I watch bits of cardboard, shards of billowing plastic and other ephemera hurtle down a conveyor belt. The whirr and clank of machinery fills the air, and there's a slight whiff of garbage as a truck disgorges a steady stream of recycling on the floor. "", 'A forklift truck piles everything on the belt, ready for sorting. Covering an area of 20,000 square metres - nearly four football fields - this site in central London handles 120,000 tonnes of recycling a year, or roughly 25 tonnes per hour.', '""What we\'d like to convey to people is that recycling does work - there are a hundred facilities like this one across the UK,"" says Tim Duret, director of sustainability technology at Veolia UK, which runs this plant in Southwark. ""The objective is to sort the mixed waste into different fractions - the glass, the plastics, the metals and the fibre [paper and cardboard]. And we understand that it is not always simple to know what can and what can\'t be recycled.""', ""You can say that again. Turn over a food packet and you'll find a mindboggling array of recycling symbols. And while the packaging might say something is recyclable, that doesn't mean your council will accept it. One council's recycling is another council's general waste, so it's important to always check your local rules."", ""Here in London, hand pickers wearing gloves and masks are the first line of defence against the wishcyclers. Their hands shoot out with lightning speed to snatch things from the conveyor belt that shouldn't be there, from plastic bags and bits of polythene, to what looks like a plastic hose. "", 'Plastic causes particular confusion, with the likes of carrier bags, frozen food bags, bread food bags, crisp packets and pet food pouches often ending up in the recycling bin by mistake. ""That is by far and away the largest amount of stuff that isn\'t targeted by the local authority, so comes into your wishcycling bracket,"" says Helen Bird, recycling expert at the waste reduction charity, Wrap.', 'She says some supermarkets are starting to collect crisp packets, plastic bags and other food wrapping in an effort to build new markets for products made from other types of plastics, from refuse sacks to toilet brushes.', 'I\'m not sure if my plastic conditioner bottle can be recycled and, as it turns out, I\'m not alone. According to Wrap, more than half of households put items in general waste that could be recycled, including shampoo and conditioner bottles, cleaning and bleach bottles, foil and aerosols. ""If it\'s plastic and bottle-shaped it can go in [the recycling],"" says Helen.', 'My ready meal container presents another dilemma. Tim says the plastic tub is accepted here, but that\'s not the case everywhere. The plastic film can\'t be recycled, though. It must be peeled off and put in with the general rubbish. As for any lingering lentils and mash - ""3D"" food, as he puts it, should be scraped off and emptied out.', ""My coffee cup is a firm reject. Though made from a type of fibre - cellulose - the cup has a thin plastic lining, which rules it out. And the plastic lid can't be recycled either; instead the whole caboodle should be taken to coffee shops or other outlets, such as railway stations, which run take-back schemes. If kept separated from other materials, coffee cups can be recycled."", ""Thankfully, my pizza box, while greasy, isn't so messy it fails the test. Tim drops it on the conveyor belt, where I watch it leap down the line to join other cardboard boxes. My shopping receipt can go in too. I was worried it was made of the wrong kind of paper - some are printed on shiny paper that can't be recycled in many places. It's another item that causes confusion. I'm told mine is fine."", ""Relieved some of my things have passed muster, I'm shown some of the more extreme items rejected by the hand pickers. There are frying pans, bits of a microwave, parts of a television. And textiles such as jeans and tights, which can get tangled up in the machinery causing the whole production line to grind to a halt. "", 'When we stare down at the optical sorters - a series of spinning discs that sort things by size and shape - we notice a long pink ribbon has wrapped itself around part of the sorting apparatus like a snake. ""There are people who will put any old rubbish in the recycling,"" Helen says. ', '""Things like nappies, sanitary products, dog poo, dead animals, syringes. The belt will be stopped - physically somebody has to go through that stuff and pull it out. Fortunately, they are really in the minority.""', 'As we walk along the gantry, different streams of glass, plastics, metals and paper are emerging and chugging off in different directions as the machines sort stuff by size, shape, colour and structure, using lights and lasers, magnets and artificial intelligence. ', '""At the end we still rely on people to manually touch the waste and remove what\'s not meant to be there on the belt,"" says Tim. ""Then we are sure that at the end of the process we\'ve got sorted material: clean, 99% pure, which can then go to another facility.""', 'We go down to the factory floor, where all the sorted material is waiting to be collected. Bales of squashed cardboard and paper are stacked up higher than my head, ready to be taken to the paper mill. The plastics and glass will go off to be separated out and processed, while the aluminium and other metals can be taken to smelters to be re-melted and turned into new things, such as bicycles.', 'Recycling can reduce carbon emissions, because producing new products from recycled objects generally saves energy. Making aluminium cans from recycled scraps of the metal, for instance, is far more energy efficient than making the same from scratch. ', ""And figures show we are getting better at recycling. According to Wrap's latest survey, we're now very much a nation of recyclers with nine out of 10 people recycling, saving 18 million tonnes of CO2 every year, the same as taking 12 million cars off the road."", '""Ultimately, we\'re all just trying to do our best - we all really want to recycle as much as we can,"" Helen says of the wishcyclers. ""It\'s down to the companies that produce the packaging to start with to make it simple in terms of design and for the local authorities to be able to collect the stuff.""', 'But there are limits to what recycling can achieve, when it comes to reducing emissions. Tim says while there has been a ""huge increase"" in recycling rates in recent years, we need to do more, which relies on government investment. ', '""Technically we know how to do it, but we need more facilities in the UK, which will create jobs and help the economic recovery,"" he says. And there are those who argue we need to re-think our whole approach to waste - after all, isn\'t it better to buy less in the first place?

And those emergencies - from wildfires to flooding - are likely to become more frequent because of the climate crisis.', 'So why are disabled people so affected by climate change and what can we do about it?', 'In July 2018, a heatwave hit Montreal, Canada. Temperatures soared to 35.5C (95.9F) for days. Hospitals became busy with those experiencing the effects of heat and 61 people died. A quarter of those had schizophrenia.', '""That\'s 500 times their share of the population,"" says Prof Sébastien Jodoin, a climate change specialist from McGill University, who has multiple sclerosis and studies the relationship between human rights, disability and the climate crisis. ', 'Many people with schizophrenia take anti-psychotic medication to treat their symptoms. It can make patients less tolerant to heat, increasing the risk of heatstroke and severe dehydration, which can prove fatal. ', ""Professor Jodoin says it's the lack of communication between authorities and at-risk communities that exacerbates these situations."", '""People who live with schizophrenia tend to have less of a social network, they tend to be more poor,"" he says. ""These are the underlying effects of how disability will increase vulnerability or engender vulnerability, to climate change.""', 'Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather, which is likely to lead to more heatwaves and fuel wildfires. A warming atmosphere also makes extreme rainfall and flooding more likely.', 'Professor Jodoin says what happened in Montreal is a snapshot of what is to come.', 'In 2019, California was hit with a series of outages as companies shut down power to prevent wildfires spreading. Gerald Niimi, from Santa Rosa in North California, had managed a chronic lung disease for years and relied on an oxygen ventilator to help him breathe.', 'But when the power-outage hit, his ventilator stopped. He and his wife fled their home and desperately searched for a working vent, but failed. Gerald died two days later. ', 'Energy supplier Pacific Gas & Electric later admitted it had failed to notify thousands of customers, including hundreds with medical conditions, before shutting off their power. ', 'During the wildfires, some disabled Californians had difficulty fleeing their homes. Those who were able to escape found many of the emergency centres providing water, bathrooms and a safe space, were not accessible.', 'This summer, 12 disabled care home residents in the town of Sinzig, in Germany, died when sudden flooding hit - they had been unable to evacuate. The floods have been linked to climate change by scientists and politicians. ', 'Dr Charles Williams, a climate scientist and research fellow at the University of Bristol, has spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). ""As a wheelchair-user, I would not be able to get into a rubber dinghy to be evacuated,"" he says.', 'Similar stories emerged after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, causing serious flooding. A report, by the US-based National Council on Disabilities, found disabled people struggled to access support. ', 'Most evacuation busses did not have wheelchair lifts, many of the emergency shelters were inaccessible and people with visual and hearing impairments were unable to obtain local safety information.', 'Weather-related disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, have increased five-fold over the past 50 years. So what needs to happen to better support disabled people?', 'Andy Greene, from Disabled People Against Cuts (DPAC), believes disabled people need to be more involved in climate change discussions - particularly when new laws are brought in. ', 'He says governments often overlook the impact of legislation on those who are disabled, pointing to the crackdown on plastic straws as one example.', 'After a Sir David Attenborough documentary highlighted how take-away containers were littering the seas, a public outcry led to legislation banning single-use plastic straws. ', 'The new law included an exemption for those who need to use plastic straws for medical reasons, but Mr Greene says many disabled people were still adversely affected as they rely on the availability of plastic straws to drink independently. ', ""Replacements like metal or pasta straws are hard and can cause damage if, for instance, the person using them were to slip or spasm while drinking. And paper straws tend to collapse. That's why bendable plastic is important for those who can't pick up a cup."", '""Disabled people [who use straws] are a very small group, but this ban has a real impact on them - while having a minimal actual real impact on the structural effects of climate change and global warming,"" he says.', ""He believes it's another example of disabled people being forgotten and left behind. "", 'The term ""eco-ableism"" is now being  used to describe this sort of discrimination. It refers to the failure of decision-makers and activists to consider that some environmental actions make life more difficult for disabled people - such as removing disabled parking bays to make way for cycle lanes. ', 'At COP26, some side events will specifically explore disability and climate change. One event will look at inclusive designs for climate resilient cities, while another will highlight the impact of climate change on the health of disabled people.', 'Prof Jodoin says governments often do not think of the ""specific requirements of people with disabilities"". But he sees COP26 as ""an opportunity to push disability rights"".', 'Dr Williams says ""there are reasons to be hopeful"" about tackling climate change. He says the problem so far has been the ""apparent lack of motivation and willpower"" to make changes on an individual and political level.  ', '""Only time will tell if these attitudes will change.

We need to limit climate change as low as possible and 1.5C is a good target to maintain.""', 'Emissions in China are expected to be 5.5% higher in 2021 than in 2019 and are also projected to rise in India, with a 4.4% increase in 2021 relative to the pre-pandemic level.', 'Dr Peters said commentators should remember that, while China is responsible for nearly 30% of global carbon emissions, that left another 70% for the rest of the world to tackle.', 'The superpower has also demonstrated weaker economic growth in the past decade and has been switching to low-carbon energy sources at a faster rate than many other countries.', 'Its emissions growth this year is related to stimulus packages - focused on heavy industry - which are in turn a response to the Covid-related slowdown. ', '""China is doing very well on many dimensions: it\'s deploying solar, it\'s deploying wind, electric buses, electric vehicles, and so there\'s lots of positive things going on in China,"" Dr Peters explained.

These contribute to global warming.', 'Emissions per kilometre travelled are known to be significantly worse than any other form of transport.', 'But this varies considerably depending on size, occupancy levels and efficiency. Private jets generally produce significantly more emissions per passenger than commercial flights.

', 'The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) says 2.52kg of carbon dioxide is emitted for every litre of aviation turbine fuel burned. Therefore this flight would produce 5.9 tonnes of CO2.', 'However, BEIS recommends that to ""capture the maximum climate impact"" of flights, CO2 emissions figures should be multiplied by 1.9 to reflect the effect of non-CO2 emissions released by planes at high altitude, which, scientists say, increase the warming effect. ', 'Therefore, the total emissions for this flight would be 11.3 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, and with a capacity of nine, each passenger would be responsible for 1.2 tonnes on their journey.', 'If, however, our world leaders had decided to take a commercial flight from Rome to Glasgow their emissions would have been a quarter of a tonne each. Even though a commercial flight uses more fuel per hour, it is able to fly far more passengers than a private jet and therefore produces fewer emissions per person.

', '""In the \'80s, essentially the message was that this was the largest environmental problem of all time,"" says Peringe Grennfelt, a Swedish scientist who played a key role in highlighting the dangers of acid rain.  ', 'Headlines warning of the threats of acid rain were commonplace. For years there had been obfuscation, denial and diplomatic stand-offs, but once the science was settled beyond doubt, calls for action quickly gathered momentum. It led to international agreements curbing the pollutants from burning fossil fuels that acidify rain.', 'Amendments to the Clean Air Act in the US saw the development of a cap and trade system, giving companies an incentive to reduce emissions of sulphur and nitrogen, and trade any excess allowances. Each year, the cap was ratcheted down until emissions dropped dramatically. ', 'So did it work? Acid rain is now largely a thing of the past in Europe and North America, although it remains a problem elsewhere, particularly in Asia. ', 'However, Canadian scientist John Smol, a young researcher back in the 1980s, says in many ways acid rain was a ""success story"", showing that countries can come together and deal with an international problem. ""If you don\'t price pollution, people will pollute. We learned that for sure,"" he says.', 'In 1985, news of another looming environmental problem hit the headlines. Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) alerted the world to a large and expanding hole in the ozone layer above the Antarctic. It was caused by the chlorofluorocarbons -  greenhouse gases better known as CFCs - then used in aerosols and refrigerants. ', '""Suddenly it goes \'boom\', and it drops really quickly,"" says BAS polar scientist Anna Jones, referring to the dramatic thinning of the band of gas that shields the planet from harmful UV rays. ', 'Ozone over the Antarctic had been diminishing since the 1970s, but news the hole now covered the entire Antarctic continent triggered worldwide alarm. In 1987, world leaders signed the landmark Montreal Protocol, hailed as one of the most successful environmental treaties of all time. ', 'Ozone-depleting chemicals were phased out, with industry switching to ""CFC-free"" aerosol cans that appealed to green consumers. ""It was a global problem, but industry, the scientists, the policymakers came together,"" says Dr Jones. ', '""They acted quickly; they acted with a mechanism that allowed continual tightening of that protocol. It\'s a very important template for how you can make things work."" ', 'Despite the success of the Montreal Protocol, there have been setbacks. It was discovered that hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), developed as alternatives to ozone-depleting chemicals, were potent greenhouse gases. ', 'And there was a mysterious spike in CFCs traced to China. Both led to further action. And while the ozone hole is ""on the road to recovery"", ozone-depleting chemicals stay in the atmosphere for a long time, meaning repair is a long, slow process. ', 'For decades we used leaded petrol as fuel - as companies added lead additives to help petrol burn more efficiently. Leaded petrol releases lead particles into vehicle exhausts that can be breathed in, causing a variety of health problems, including heart attacks, strokes and impaired mental development in children.', 'After a long battle between scientists, regulatory authorities and industry, a consensus around the health risks emerged, and rich nations banned leaded petrol from the 1980s onwards.  ', ""Use in developing countries lingered on, however, owing to the fuel being cheaper to produce than unleaded petrol. Following a long campaign by NGOs, industry groups and governments, under the umbrella of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the final drop of leaded petrol was pumped into a car's tank only months ago. "", 'And while the world has officially eradicated leaded fuel, lead pollution lingers on in the environment in dust and soil, where it can persist for a long time.', 'With climate change dominating the news agenda, we hear very little nowadays about the likes of the ozone hole. Yet, there are parallels between these crises and the monumental one that is climate change. ', 'For a long time, acid rain was a source of international conflict, with some denying its very existence and the fossil fuel industry pitted against environmentalists. Does that sound familiar? ', 'According to Prof Smol, the debates and discussions over acid rain were training for the more complex issues of climate change. ""The first lesson I learned was that we had to effectively communicate the results of our studies, not just to other scientists but to policymakers and the public at large,"" he says. ', '""If there is an information vacuum, it will be immediately filled by vested interest groups."" ', 'Prof Smol says the situation is even more complicated today, with the growth of social media and the spread of misinformation.  ', 'When it comes to the international push to eliminate leaded fuel, Rob de Jong, head of UNEP\'s sustainable mobility unit, says a key lesson was the value of a harmonised approach. ""The whole leaded petrol campaign heavily invested in public awareness, heavily invested in social and community action, heavily invested in focusing on the impact this has on children.""', 'And the steps taken by the international community to reduce ozone-depleting chemicals show - on a smaller scale - the kind of co-operation that will be needed to tackle the warming world. ', '""The climate change problem is much more complicated to solve than the ozone problem because we don\'t have immediate alternatives to fossil fuels in the way that we had alternatives to CFCs,"" says Dr Jones. ""But, that\'s not a reason for not doing something - the problem is too important, it\'s too big and they need to get on with it. ', '""When industry and governments have come together in the past they have solved a globally-threatening environmental problem - now they need to show they can do it again.""

They don\'t always occur as it requires certain atmospheric conditions: the air must be very cold, humid and ""supersaturated"" for ice to form. ', 'They trap and absorb outgoing heat which otherwise escapes into space. This worsens at night when it is colder and the contrail has a longer lifetime. They can also have a less significant cooling effect, blocking incoming sunlight - but only during daytime.', 'Contrails can last for seconds, hours or even a day in the atmosphere - and this determines the climate impact of a particular contrail will have. But recent research shows there could be a solution for this overlooked issue. ', 'Dr Marc Stettler, transport and environment lecturer at Imperial College London, says changing the altitude of fewer than 2% of flights could potentially reduce contrail-linked climate change by a staggering 59%. ""Tweaking the flight elevation by just a thousand feet can stop some contrails from forming,"" he explains.', 'Adjustments would mean an aircraft could avoid some of the regions of the atmosphere that are cold and humid enough to create contrails in the first place. ', '""A relatively small proportion of flights contribute to the majority of climate impact. So if we can alter these flights, we can significantly reduce the climate impact,"" says Dr Stettler. ', 'Recent research from Prof Christiane Voigt, head of the cloud physics department at Mainz University, Germany, underlines this. ', 'She has been conducting trials with the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) to measure and mitigate the impact of contrails. ', ""Her team use high-altitude long-range (HALO) G550 research aircraft to gather their data. The aircraft carries wing-mounted instruments measuring contrail properties and the light scattered by radiation. This allows them to evaluate their forecasts' accuracy and investigate the impact of radiation."", '""Our results have been really positive. We were able to predict and avoid around 80% of the contrails with little cost,"" she says. Prof Voigt adds that very few flights would have to be deviated to win a ""large climate impact"". ', 'While there were some uncertainties, her team were able to track down most of the contrails and avoid the correct areas. ', '""We are at the beginning of a race to avoid them. And I have the impression that [companies] such as Lufthansa and Airbus, are really interested, as it is low cost and effective,"" she says.', 'Royal Aeronautical Society fellow, Prof Keith Hayward, is optimistic it may only need a software tweak to adjust many flight plans to avoid contrail creation, and that this could be done at a relatively low cost. ', 'Compared to the typical $200m cost of a passenger aircraft or engine changes which can run to $12m, a software change is relatively inexpensive, he says.', 'Prof Hayward says the next challenge is for airlines to work out how altitude changes of a ""few thousand feet"" can be made mid-flight to avoid contrails while also not disrupting passengers\' comfort. A pilot would need to spot these in ""sufficient time for an aircraft to adapt gracefully"", he adds.  ', ""But Prof Voigt does not believe this is necessarily a problem. She thinks flight comfort could improve as flight paths would avoid some of the sky's water vapour areas - which both form contrails and cause bumpy turbulence."", ""Raimund Zopp, former pilot and co-founder of Austrian flight services software company, Flightkeys, is working on contrail visualisations to programme into flight plan technology. The company plans to include contrail avoidance in their airline customers' flight plan trajectories by 2023. "", '""Only a very small portion of flights are causing the problem so you only need to change a few flight plans to have a huge effect,"" he says.  ', 'As a former pilot, Mr Zopp says that from a flight procedure perspective, adding this information would be easy. ""The flight plans get programmed into the navigation of the plane system, but pilots need training on this new contrail aspect of the flight plan profile"".', ""Any action on climate change that doesn't relate directly to cutting emissions is lower down the priority list for governments and industry, because CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas for most sectors. "", 'Yet unlike other sectors, aviation also has very significant non-CO2 impacts. ', 'Dr Stettler believes that people have hesitated to reduce contrails by diverting flights because of fears it would be completely unfeasible - that all flights might have to be changed or it would hugely increase fuel consumption. This latest research shows this is not the case. ', 'Dr Jarlath Molloy, senior environmental affairs manager at the air traffic service provider, NATS, agrees that up until now, there has been a lack of focus on non-CO2 problems from the entire industry.', 'Yet from an operational perspective, tackling contrails is ""just one extra element the aircraft would have to compute"", he says, and it could even be managed in a similar way to how authorities already orchestrate groups of flights to avoid big winter storms. ', '""We\'re exploring the feasibility of it and what we\'d have to do to manage flights looking for the same routes"" Dr Molloy adds.', 'The Department for Transport says it is ""currently considering"" a range of responses to its Jet Zero consultation on how to ""make the sector cleaner and greener"", and that this strategy ""will aim to address"" aviation\'s non-CO2 impact.  ', 'Meanwhile atmospheric scientist Prof Ken Caldiera, from the Carnegie Institution for Science, makes a compelling case. He estimates preventing most of the damaging climate impact of contrails would cost less than $1bn (£720m) a year and the net value of the benefit could be more than a thousand times that.', '""We know of no comparable climate investment with a similarly high likelihood of success,"" he wrote in the scientific journal Nature.', 'So could a financial penalty focus minds in aviation more quickly? Dr Andrew Gettleman of the US National Center for Atmospheric Research says while more research is needed, a contrail tax or avoidance rebate could be introduced if a carbon tax were approved. ', '""We haven\'t seen the overall regulatory scheme yet for carbon in aviation, but once we get a larger regime in place for mitigating climate change and reducing carbon - then we can tackle the contrail problem properly.""']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/240/cpsprodpb/E8C9/production/_121139595_contrailsindex2gettyimages-141170081.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1397D/production/_121135208_mediaitem120788534.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/136E9/production/_121139597_contrailsindexgettyimages-1157129980.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3514/production/_120788531_mediaitem120788530.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8334/production/_120788533_mediaitem120788532.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/BDCC/production/_120788584_mediaitem120788583.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/11F74/production/_120788537_mediaitem120788536.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/16D94/production/_120788539_mediaitem120788538.jpg']"

Then when there's a surge in demand, they can power down as the freezer temperatures slip back to normal."", 'They are paid in effect for storing energy through cold.

The international engineering company Arup helped out with some of the practicalities."", 'Graham Dodd of Arup says encasing 256 year-old air within glass was a challenge.

""I\'ve watched a lot of YouTubers. And I think it was one of them that made me go, yeah, I should look at my money.""', ""Bethan works part-time in a shop in Guernsey, and doesn't manage to save a great deal, but she has £1,000 put away for a rainy day, and she would like to know it's not doing more harm than good. "", '""I don\'t want to be funding fossil fuels or big mining operations,"" she says.', 'As the urgency to act on climate change has become clearer, many people feel the same: wondering whether by moving their money they could make a difference. ', ""But as Bethan found, investing sustainably can be daunting. Many investment and savings providers make big claims about how climate-friendly their products are, but it can be hard to work out how much genuine impact they're likely to have."", 'There are plenty of options, says Lisa Stanley, co-founder of the website Good with Money, which provides information to make ethical investing easier. It says it offers a jargon-free guide for first-time investors, like Bethan, and is financed through advertising and through a kitemark scheme it runs.', '""Step one is to look at your bank - are you happy with its environmental record?"" says Ms Stanley. ""In general, I would say products at mainstream High Street banks are not going to be the greenest.""', 'Bethan could shift her £1,000 into a savings account at an ethical bank or building society, says Ms Stanley, or she could look for a climate-friendly investment fund. ', 'Usually these funds simply screen out specific sectors that are seen as problematic, such as big energy, tobacco and armaments. ', 'However, some funds will take a more active approach, lobbying for more climate-friendly strategies, or investing in businesses with a positive impact on the planet.', 'Source: Good With Money Guide to First Time Investing', ""There's been a boom in sustainable investing in recent years, due to rising awareness of environmental issues. "", 'And as governments have made their commitments towards tackling climate change clearer investing in the companies that are on right side of the transition, has started to make financial sense too, adds Ms Stanley.', ""But it isn't always obvious what should count as a green investment. For example, some funds give the electric car company Tesla a high score thanks to its products. Others put it near the bottom of the climate-friendly list, due to its dalliances with Bitcoin and the damage done by lithium mining for use in its batteries."", 'If Bethan chooses a fund that simply avoids investing in fossil fuel firms, she might find, with further digging, that it still invests in petrol refineries or other closely related businesses.', 'So, she\'s not sure a fund like that would go far enough. ""I\'d much prefer knowing the money was going for a good cause, rather than just avoiding the bad stuff,"" she says.', ""That's the approach Louis Velati has taken.

', '""The impact investing funds were very exciting,"" says Louis. ""I really liked how you could see where your money was going. You feel very connected to the projects your money is going towards.""', 'Another option for Bethan could be to choose a fund that promises to positively engage with firms, instead of simply avoiding heavily-polluting sectors. ', ""Engagement means the fund's manager will call for change and support pro-climate motions at shareholder meetings, explains Ms Stanley. "", ""More active approaches help avoid some of the pitfalls sustainable investing can fall into. In recent years, there's been a boom in big investment funds labelled ESG - Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance funds - reflecting a really wide range of ethical considerations, from workers' rights, to how well the firm is managed. "", 'Huge investment flows have flooded into ESG funds, as interest has grown in responsible investing, but their climate impact is sometimes not as good as the marketing may suggest.', 'A report by InfluenceMap, a think tank, looked at investment funds which used pro-climate branding. ', 'The think tank found fewer than half of the funds had overall investments that aligned with globally agreed climate change targets.', 'Another piece of recent research by French business school, Edhec, found ""greenwashing"" by funds claiming to be climate-friendly disguised the limited impact their investments were having. ', ""It said money wasn't flowing to companies that were improving their environmental record, while many that were deteriorating were still being funded."", 'One leading fund manager, BlackRock\'s chief investment officer for sustainable investing, Tariq Fancy, left his job in frustration. He has denounced ESG investing as ""sustain-a-babble"" arguing it does more harm than good because people think they\'re tackling climate change when they\'re not.', 'Ultimately, though, these problems will have to be resolved, says Ben Caldecott, the Lombard Odier associate professor of sustainable finance at the University of Oxford, because shifting financial flows is an essential part of the decarbonisation process.', '""There is no solution that doesn\'t involve the financial sector changing rapidly. There is no transition without it,"" he says.', 'In fact, how to mobilise private finance is high on the agenda at the COP26 meeting in Glasgow, taking place in November, where world leaders will be hammering out new commitments and strategies for reducing carbon emissions.', '""If we want to tackle climate change, we want fossil fuel companies to pay much higher interest rates, so it\'s harder for them to raise money.

The nature of fast fashion trends means they are not designed to have long lives in our wardrobes.""', 'According to the Clean Clothes campaign, in 2018 three out of five of our clothing purchases ended up on the landfill site.', 'The RSA is calling for the government to look at introducing a plastics tax on clothes imported into or produced in the UK.', 'Facing a climate of increased environmental awareness, being seen to go green is big business.

""A lot of the new technology is not fully commercialised because not enough brands buy it."" ', 'This is in part due to consumer demand. Fast fashion retailers such as Boohoo and Oh Polly were able to quickly react during the pandemic because, for them, the time between finishing a design to getting it made is often less than a week.', 'Boohoo has been one of the best performers in terms of online retail - it increased quarterly sales by 45% to £368m in the three months until the end of May 2020.', 'For this to change, Pan says ""customers need to reject these irresponsible production models, then brands will have no choice but to change and adopt new practices"".', '""When we buy a £10 disposable t-shirt, the true cost to the environment and society is a lot more. So the question is, are we willing to pay for something disposable, even it means we have a toxic future to worry about, or are we happier to pay for fewer items that are made more environmental processes and fair labour treatment?""', 'The key to change, Pan believes, is government legislation to back up increased awareness amongst consumers. She cites the shifting attitude toward the tobacco industry in the name of public health as a template.', 'Pan says the pandemic, which has hit traditional retailers hard, can be the perfect reset point. The COP26 environmental summit in November, led by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, is set to discuss sustainable fashion.', 'Earlier this month Stockholm Fashion Week set a strong precedent by focusing on addressing sustainability, technology and creativity in the industry.', '""Universally agreed upon are several issues plaguing the industry"" wrote Forbes, from overproduction to misjudging consumer want and harmful working practices. ', '""The solutions to these issues will rely heavily on tech, legislation, financing, and collaboration across the industry, [one] notorious for not working together. It is also highly unregulated"" it continued.', '""The industry needs to make strides to change either from a moral obligation or demand imposed by the consumer"".', 'Prof Fletcher agrees. ""The future for fashion is exciting"" she says. ""It is also different to today - the fashion industry will take a smaller and less central role.

For decades, deforestation has been seen as a leading cause of environmental damage. Now, the full cost that losing our tree cover is having on the world's climate is being realised, and politicians are taking notice."", 'If there was a poster-child of environmental degradation, surely it is deforestation. ', 'The removal of trees - for example, through logging or fires - has, for many decades, been listed as one of the main factors behind nature loss and environmental harm. ', 'In recent years, the loss of tree cover around the world has also been firmly linked to the increasingly volatile changes to the climate.', ""Plants and trees absorb up to a third of our CO2 emissions from the atmosphere each year. Yet, as we fell vast swathes of primary forests around the globe, we are reducing our planet's ability to lock away, or sequester, the harmful gas that is released from burning fossil fuels."", 'According to the UN, an estimated 420 million hectares (one billion acres) of forest have been lost through conversion to other land uses since 1990 - that is an area roughly equivalent to the size of Libya.', 'However, campaigns to protect forests have had an impact during the past three decades. UN data suggests the rate of deforestation between 2015 and 2020 was an estimated 10 million hectares per year, down from 16 million hectares per year in the 1990s. ', 'While the issue of deforestation is taken very seriously at a global level, the implementation of strategies and policies to reduce deforestation ultimately rests with national governments.', 'At this level, the track record is much more patchy. For example, Brazil - for a succession of governments - seemed to be heeding international advice and deforestation rates had been falling steadily since 2004.', 'However, scientists writing in Nature journal last year listed the Brazilian Amazon deforestation rate for the previous 12 months as the highest in a decade.', ""Campaigners said the deforestation rate had accelerated since Jair Bolsonaro became Brazil's president in 2019. They said Mr Bolsonaro's policy of favouring agriculture and mining within the Amazon rainforest was to blame. "", 'It illustrates that international efforts to protect these valuable habitats are meaningless unless there is support from national governments.', 'In recent years, trees have become a well-trodden solution for policymakers grappling with the threat posed by climate change.', 'The ability of trees to sequester carbon is a very popular topic within the political arena. They are a well-known facet of the global carbon cycle, removing millions of tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year.', 'Therefore, policies that promote and encourage the planting of hundreds of thousands of trees are billed as a vital part of the shift to sustainability, and a key part of the solutions-based approach to tackling the climate crisis facing the planet.', 'However, there are a number of potential hurdles or limitations.', 'Firstly, can we be sure that we are planting more trees than we are losing? ', 'Are the new saplings being offered enough protection to ensure they make it to being mature specimens? It is only once that a tree reaches maturity so that it can fully absorb CO2 - on average, about 21kg each year.', 'What species are being planted to sequester carbon? Are they fast-growing or slow-growing? How long do they live? What happens when they die? Will the timber be used for materials and construction or will it be left to rot, releasing the carbon it had locked away from the atmosphere?', 'It has also been identified in a number of studies in urban areas that tree planting schemes are struggling to keep up with the number of trees felled in the name of development.', 'Secondly, as only mature trees can make a meaningful contribution to sequestering carbon, it will take many decades for a sapling to reach maturity. ', ""Therefore, the trees we are planting today will only be making a meaningful difference to the volume of CO2 in our atmosphere in half a century's time."", 'A famous Chinese saying suggests that the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago.', 'However, it adds, the second best time is today - so there is still hope.', 'As another popular saying states: better late than never.']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/240/cpsprodpb/9383/production/_115736773_hi064132541-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ED5C/production/_115746706_optimised-amazongdp-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9383/production/_115736773_hi064132541-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1CC4/production/_115746370_mediaitem115692680.jpg']"

', 'Meanwhile, new rounds of licences continued to be distributed to oil companies, giving them permission to explore for new reserves.', 'That policy changed in March. Gone was ""financial support for the fossil fuel energy sector...""  So all those tax breaks for drilling, which gathered pace over the past ten years? Gone?  Er, no.  The next word was ""overseas"".  ', 'There was also a requirement that new licences have to pass ""a new climate compatibility checkpoint before each future oil and gas licensing round to ensure licences awarded are aligned with wider climate objectives, including net-zero emissions by 2050"".  (Good luck to the OGA in making sense of that.)', 'The North Sea Transition Deal was a pact with the industry to say it could keep drilling and producing, but it would have to invest a lot in reducing its own considerable emissions in the production process, down by half within nine years. ', ""It also committed to pour billions into the shift to hydrogen production, and to carbon capture and storage. The industry likes that, even if neither is yet commercially viable. It's allowed to keep drilling for oil and gas, and in turn, government has to remove obstacles to those mitigating new industries."", ""In short. We're in a transition, and the decline of the UK's offshore oil and gas sector is now in political play. Its decline was inevitable, with production potentially lasting five or six more decades. But the question now is how fast it should be allowed or required to happen."", ""The industry points out there are jobs at stake. The number in the UK's oil and gas sector has fallen, but it's still plenty - around 150,000 directly or indirectly employed, and these are high-value jobs."", 'In Scotland, the estimate is of 108,000 jobs, also including those supported by induced spending (when oil workers spend their salaries).', 'Many are in the hard-fought political territory of north-east Scotland. And that is why Nicola Sturgeon is in a particularly difficult position.', 'Labour says she must firmly and loudly say ""no"" to Cambo. Scottish Greens expect no less, and it will be interesting to see if they extract a shift in tone from their deal on sharing government power.', 'Under pressure to take sides, the first minister has issued a very cautious call for licensing to be ""reassessed"" and for the ""just transition"" to be ""appropriately rapid"". But her letter to Boris Johnson also carries a heavy emphasis on the importance of jobs to the UK and Scottish economy. It\'s a difficult line to tread. Or an uncomfortable fence to sit on.', 'The startling report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week pushes politicians and public towards more acceptance that oil and gas developments will have to be, at least, reined in.', ""The industry counters that not all of its output is burned. It's important for chemicals and plastics. Its advocates add that the transition to renewable energy has a long way to run. And until it is finished, there will be a need for oil to power trucks, trains and planes, and for gas to heat homes and businesses. "", 'The consequence of stopping new developments, and putting a chill on further investment in existing fields, could be rising prices, bringing the opposite political pressure from consumers. ', ""And if not oil and gas from British waters, which provide roughly half of the country's energy needs, that would mean higher dependence on imported energy, at a cost in dollars, the emissions from oil tankers, and diplomatic clout. Do we really want to give up a British industry, to rely instead on the Persian Gulf and Russia?"", ""Yet the energy industry itself is on the move. Oil companies like BP, Shell, Equinor, Total and ENI - though less so the US majors - are pouring investment into renewable energy, in response to consumer and investor pressure. They don't want to be left stranded, like some of those offshore reserves, if political support is also withdrawn."", 'Similar dilemmas afflict other political leaders. President Joe Biden has taken a much firmer line than his predecessor on the risks of climate change; re-committing to the Paris accord, revoking permission for a key pipeline, and pulling back on drilling licences on federal land and the Arctic.', 'But with oil prices relatively high, and causing pain on the American forecourt, domestic political pressure now sees him calling on the Opec oil exporting cartel to turn the taps on, and get the price down.', ""Others have decided to stop drilling for new reserves, though not many.  Denmark did so last December.  The new administration in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, has ended years of speculation that its waters could be a huge new basin of hydrocarbon reserves. That saw Edinburgh's Cairn Energy as one of the pioneering drillers, now departed for warmer waters, including the North Sea."", 'Such countries have other options - Denmark with renewables, and Greenland with onshore minerals.', 'Scotland has abundant renewables as well. A report from Scottish Enterprise this week set out the case for Scotland to be a world leader in hydrogen production, but also set out the threat that others can rival it, at lower cost.', 'That ""just transition"", meaning economic justice for those affected, is perhaps the most important challenge facing the Scottish government as well as the UK one. The growing pressure to make it ""appropriately rapid"" doesn\'t make it any easier.']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/240/cpsprodpb/12409/production/_119916747__87679941_northsea_pa.gif', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/14B19/production/_119916748__87679941_northsea_pa.gif', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/914A/production/_102549173_mediaitem102549172.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/DB60/production/_115106165_hi064066385.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/139CB/production/_117713308_gettyimages-976801174.jpg']"

', 'Major sources of methane include agriculture, and leaks from oil and gas production and landfills. ', 'For decades, the main focus of efforts to curb global warming has been the ever-rising emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from human activities, such as generating power and clearing forests.

', '""It\'s a combination of sources, from agriculture, including cattle and rice production, another large source of methane is rubbish dumps,"" said Prof Peter Thorne, an IPCC author from Maynooth University in Ireland.', '""One of the biggest is from the production, transport and use of natural gas - which is really misnamed and should be called fossil gas.""', ""Since 2008, there's been a big spike in methane emissions, which researchers believe is linked to the boom in fracking for gas in parts of the US."", 'In 2019, methane in the atmosphere reached record levels, around two-and-a-half times above what they were in the pre-industrial era. ', 'What worries scientists is that methane has real muscle when it comes to heating the planet. Over a 100-year period it is 28-34 times as warming as CO2.', 'Over a 20-year period it is around 84 times as powerful per unit of mass as carbon dioxide. ', ""However, one key positive about CH4 is that it doesn't last as long in the air as CO2."", '""If you emit a tonne of methane today, in a decade\'s time, I would expect half that tonne to remain in the atmosphere,"" said Prof Thorne. ', '""In two decades, time, there would be a quarter of a tonne, so basically, if we managed to stop emitting methane today by the end of this century, emissions would be down to natural levels, that they were in about 1750.""', ""In the short term, experts believe that if methane emissions were cut by 40-45% over the next decade, you'd shave 0.3C off the increase in global temperature by 2040."", ""In a world where every fraction of a degree counts, that's a potentially huge difference to hopes of keeping the 1.5C threshold alive.

After all, it covers over 70% of the planet - yet despite this we are facing a looming crisis as a species. ', 'Climate change, global conflict and overpopulation are just some of the factors that are devastating the water supply in many areas around the world. It means that two billion people -  one-quarter of the human population - are without access to safe drinking water. ', ""As the world's population creeps ever closer to eight billion, attention is being focused on developing technologies that can help address this before it is too late. "", 'One of those offering a potential solution is Michael Mirilashvili, head of Watergen, an Israel-based firm that is using its air-to-water technology to deliver the drinking water to remote areas of the world hit by conflict or climate change. ', '""Water is a basic human right, and yet millions don\'t have access to it,"" he tells the BBC. ', ""Pulling water out of thin air may sound like science fiction, but the technology is actually simpler than it seems. The Earth's atmosphere contains 13 billion tonnes of fresh water. Watergen's machines work by filtering this water vapour out of the air. He says if used correctly, Watergen's technology could spark a major shift within the water industry that could have a lasting impact on the planet. "", '""A big advantage of using atmospheric water is that there\'s no need to build water transportation, so no worries about heavy metals in pipes for example or cleaning contaminated water from the ground or polluting the planet with plastic bottles.""', ""One obvious obstacle would appear to be air pollution, which has become a widespread cause for concern in some of the world's major cities. In the UK for example, research by Imperial College London found lead, which is toxic to the human body, still present in the city's air in 2021 despite it being banned in 1999. "", ""However, this may not matter. A study conducted by scientists from Israel's Tel Aviv University found that even in urban areas such as Tel Aviv, it is possible to extract drinking water to a standard set by the World Health Organization. In other words, clean water can be converted from air that is dirty or polluted. "", ""Watergen's largest machines can provide 6,000 litres of water in a day. It has already been used to support entire hospitals in the Gaza Strip and rural villages in central Africa, where people would otherwise have to walk hours to find water. It also helped Australia's government battle devastating bush fires in 2020 that killed 34 people and destroyed 3,500 homes. "", '""This is not just about saving lives, it\'s about improving the lives of millions,"" adds Mr Mirilashvili. ""Even in developed countries some people don\'t drink clean water and it has a direct effect on health and agriculture.""', 'According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than two billion people only have access to water that is contaminated with faeces. Just one sip puts them at risk of illnesses such as cholera and typhoid, and it estimates around 500,000 people a year die as a result. ', ""When it comes to finding clean water there is a resource in our oceans. Icebergs contain some of the world's purest water as the glaciers they come from formed thousands of years ago. The giant blocks of ice can be a hazard to shipping and can damage marine ecosystems with huge volumes of freshwater when they melt. "", ""Harvesting them for profit first began in Canada, where it has become a big business along the country's east coast. But the practice has now reached other parts of the world. \xa0 "", ""Entrepreneur and environmentalist, Abdulla Al-Shehi, is working with the United Arab Emirates' iceberg project. Water scarcity poses a great risk in the country, as climate change brings with it rising temperatures to what is already one of the hottest places on the planet."", '""On average a gigantic iceberg can provide a million people water for 3-5 years,"" he claims. ""So why not take advantage of what nature can offer us? I hope one day to bring icebergs to the Arabian Peninsula."" ', 'Yet the journey poses risks. Due to their size icebergs can flip over in transit, causing fatal accidents. They must be also wrapped in specially designed insulated material to reduce the melting rate during the journey. It is no surprise that the process can therefore be expensive.', 'The UAE Iceberg project will start by harvesting a smaller iceberg and taking it to Perth in Western Australia or Cape Town in South Africa. ', '""The estimated cost ranges from $60-80m (£42-57m) and the full project will likely cost around $150-200m,"" says Mr Al-Shehi.', 'New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.', ""While the kinks are still worked out of iceberg harvesting, there are other more reliable methods using the world's oceans. In the past, many civilizations have removed salt from the seawater - a process called desalination - using heat. "", 'Nowadays, desalinisation is done using seawater reverse osmosis. Some governments own desalination plants that provide water to the population, while others rely on private firms to run them. ', 'Water provider giant Dupont, based in Delaware, processes 25 million US gallons (94 million litres) of water every minute at its plants around the world. ', '""The process allows water to pass through a filter while salts get separated. As a result, two streams are generated, one with drinkable water and one with high levels of salt,"" says Verónica García Molina, global market leader of DuPont Water Solutions. ', '""The stream with high concentrations in salts is directed back to the sea, but thanks to proper dilution mechanisms and processes there is no impact in the sea.""', 'Yet while modern plants may have little to no impact on the sea, the same cannot be said for older factories that still use less advanced desalination methods. These are still pumping high levels of brine back into the ocean which can wreak havoc on ecosystems by reducing oxygen levels and increasing salt content. ', 'A large majority of these older plants are located in the Middle East, where 55% of desalination brine is pumped back into the oceans. ', 'Another major criticism of desalination is that it takes a tremendous amount of energy to process seawater, usually driven by highly polluting fossil fuels. ', 'However, Ms Molina says advances in technology in recent years have made it one of the most viable solutions to solving water shortages around the world. ', '""Energy required for seawater reverse osmosis has been reduced by more than three times in the last decades and today it consumes four-five times or less energy than the old thermal processes,"" she adds.

"", 'One key change will be higher temperatures. The CCC warns that a quarter of UK homes are in danger of overheating. People in the UK have tended to focus on making buildings warm, but increasingly more awareness will be needed of how to keep them cool.', 'More Technology of Business', 'Thankfully, some of the best measures are also some of the simplest. The CCC refers to ""low-regret"" or ""no-regret"" actions. These include using thick blinds and curtains, closing windows when it\'s hotter outside than inside and ensuring proper ventilation.', 'Fionnuala Walravens, a campaigner at the Environmental Investigation Agency, also advocates a common-sense approach to staying cool. ""The first kind of approach to sustainable cooling is to ask, \'do you actually need cooling?\'"" ', ""When thoughtful design maximises shade, airflow and ventilation, the answer may be no. Mr Heal's house has internal blinds on all windows and thick insulation that buffers the house against extreme temperatures. It's essentially airtight, he says. "", 'Passive cooling can minimise the need for air conditioning, which takes a huge toll on the environment in the forms of energy gobbled up, excess heat expelled, and damaging hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) emitted. If mechanical cooling is needed, Ms Walravens recommends energy efficient units that use natural refrigerants in place of HFCs (as well as HFC-free heat pumps). ', 'One obstacle to this kind of future-proofing is lack of information. ', 'Iggy Bassi heads the climate-intelligence company, Cervest, which uses artificial intelligence to provide highly specific information on climate-related risks, right down to the individual property level.', 'Cervest\'s product EarthScan is available in a ""freemium"" model to small-scale users. This allows people to see, within five-year increments, the intensity, types and interactions of climate risks for a factory, say, or a farm.', '""We need to get proactive about climate risk,"" says Mr Bassi, and having action that people can act upon is essential to that.', ""Using this kind of climate intelligence, a hotel company can see the risks of putting a tall building close to the coast, for example - with the risk-level changing depending on the building's height and its proximity to the shore."", 'Yet, overall, existing guidance on climate-proofing can be confusing or simply inadequate. The new UK Business Climate Hub may help to centralise information for small businesses, but it would be useful to have additional and accessible standards and tools. ', 'Along with insufficient information, costs can be a stumbling block. ', 'Not everyone will be able to design a new-build home with the care, time and expense that Mr Heal did. He estimates that the sustainability considerations led to a 5% higher spend overall.', 'The CCC is urging the government to provide more information and, especially, more financial support to encourage changes that can be initially pricey but ultimately cost-effective. For example, subsidies can encourage take-up of the most efficient, least polluting types of cooling devices.', ""Government legislation can drive change - sending the right market signals that could build climate resilience. For instance, Ms Walravens argues, only heat pumps with low greenhouse warming potential (GWP) should be allowed under the government's Renewable Heat Incentive. "", ""The CCC also says there's a need to give people incentives to adopt measures like passive-cooling and rainwater harvesting."", ""But there are still some things that people renting, and those who can't afford to retro-fit their buildings, can do now. Households at risk of flooding, for example, can move their electrical appliances up higher, and generally create a flood plan and consider flood insurance. "", 'Meanwhile, property owners and building associations may want to move electrical sockets up the wall and opt for tiled rather than carpeted floors. ', 'At the community level, natural flood defences can slow and divert the flow of water. Unlike hard barriers these allow for adjustment to sea level rise.', 'Ultimately, Mr Bassi wants a complete change in the way we view and respond to risk. ""What mayors should really be saying to themselves is - in the next three years, I only want assets in my city that are climate-proofed.""', 'Mr Heal thinks there should be more financial incentives to encourage climate-proofing: ""People are quite reluctant at the moment to invest in sustainability.""', 'That way the benefits he has experienced - from the income derived from surplus energy, to the security of knowing that his home can deal with more extreme weather - could be enjoyed by more homeowners.']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/240/cpsprodpb/A16B/production/_119532314_climate.colinhealinfrontofhisawardwinninghome.creditchristinero.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/E4CF/production/_119257585_climate.colinhealinfrontofhisawardwinninghome.creditchristinero.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/E92D/production/_119539695_gettyimages-1299112422.jpg', ""https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/132EF/production/_119257587_climate.tripleglazeddoorsincolinheal'shouse.creditchristinero.jpg"", 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1374D/production/_119539697_gettyimages-1329420879.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1810F/production/_119257589_climate.iggybassiwantsmoredetailedyetaccessibleinformationaboutclimaterisk.creditcervest.jpg', ""https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4C77/production/_119257591_climate.'roadliabletoflooding'sign.creditchristinero.jpg""]"

"", 'This is the proposal being set out for a coastal site in Aberdeenshire, and spreading far beyond, in something called the Acorn project.', 'To help fire the imagination, the Acorn project commissioned an economic model of how it might generate jobs.', 'Between a lot of construction and then operations, it is reckoned that the project could peak at around 21,000 direct and indirect jobs.', 'On average, taking into account the peaks and troughs of construction work, it would be closer to 15,000 jobs over the next three decades.', 'If it works, it would not only generate jobs but it could make a sizable dent in our climate changing challenges.
